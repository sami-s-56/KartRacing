MultiPlayer Car Game:

Force = Mass * Acceleration 
Acceleration = Force / Mass

Some basic Terms: 
 - Dampening Force (Downwards force applied by vehicle`s mass on to spring (suspension))

- Torque (Rotational Equivalent of Force)

Slipping of car: 
 - Forget about all other values (Need to be expert in physics for those), just tweaking the siffness in both sideways and for ward friction will give the skidding effect.
